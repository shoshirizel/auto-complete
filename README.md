# GoogleProject /Autocomplete
In this project I implemented one feature of Google's search engines - Autocomplete.

Autocomplete, or word completion, is a feature in which an application predicts the rest of a word a user is typing.

The purpose of the completion action is to make it easier for the user to find the most appropriate sentence.

When entering any text the user get the five results closest to what was entered.

If there are five sentences that the text is their sub-string, they will be returned.
Otherwise will be returned sentences containing the sub-string with one of the changes - a missing letter, another letter, or a replaced letter.

The results will be from sentences within given input text files.

### Example
#### The user input: 
appl

#### Results:
1. Apple is dedicated to the empowerment of man....

2. I'm applying for a job

3. An application program typically presents the user with a single structure, 
with all the other components of the system hidden.

4. This approach, however, has a couple of downsides.

5. Apparently time had caught up with Mom before she could finish.
